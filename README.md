# SensorNode_STM32_BLE_Board
This design is a compact and efficient Sensor Node featuring: 
* Onboard Temperature &amp; Humidity Sensors 🌡️
* USB-C for power and communication 🔌
* STM32 with RF BLE connectivity 📡
* 4-layer PCB stack-up (SIG | GND | GND | PWR) for signal integrity 🔧
* UART &amp; I2C breakout for easy expansion 🔗
* U.FL antenna connector for external RF flexibility 
Optimizing RF performance, power efficiency, and robust connectivity is key in this design.
I tried Draftsman documentation in Altium, and it's an excellent feature that provides a comprehensive overview of the design.
