# SensorNode_STM32_BLE_Board
I'm working on a compact and efficient Sensor Node featuring: * Onboard Temperature &amp; Humidity Sensors 🌡️ * USB-C for power and communication 🔌 * STM32 with RF BLE connectivity 📡 * 4-layer PCB stack-up (SIG | GND | GND | PWR) for signal integrity 🔧 * UART &amp; I2C breakout for easy expansion 🔗 * U.FL antenna connector for external RF flexibility
